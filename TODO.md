# TODO

## Symlinks (and similar)

Should they be silently skipped, counted somehow?

Make sure they work on Windows as well, since they have different kinds of links.

## Permission errors

What should I do about directories or files that cannot be accessed due
to permission errors?

## Display

Show a line with a summary of the other children that were not printed, if any.
Could be like "25 unlisted".

Show number of total files under directories.

Use color output?
