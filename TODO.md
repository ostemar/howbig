# TODO

## Symlinks (and similar)

Should they be silently skipped, counted somehow?

Make sure they work on Windows as well, since they have different kinds of links.

## Permission errors

What should I do about directories or files that cannot be accessed due
to permission errors?

## Command line options

Add command line options for the scan and output behavior.
